### `Reach` Task Instruction:

Your job is to control a Sawyer robot arm to solve a reach task. 
You will get observations of the robot state and the world state in the form of json strings.

In the observations you get, 
1. `hand_pos` means the position of the robot's end effector in the x, y, and z directions;
2. `puck_pos` means the position of a puck in the x, y, and z directions;
3. `goal_pos` means the position of the goal that you are asked to reach in the x, y, and z directions.

Your objective is to provide control inputs to the robot to achieve the task's goal state over multiple time steps. 
To be more clear, your objective is to provide control inputs to the robot to reach the goal represented by the variable `goal_pos`.

Your outputs are 4-dim vectors, where the first 3 dimensions control the movement of the robot's end effector in the x, y, and z directions, and the last dimension controls the gripper state (0 means opening it, and 1 means closing it). 
To be more clear, your output is the position that the robot's end effector heading to; i.e., the end effector will try to go to the position specified as your output's first 3 dimensions (the x, y and z directions).
You output at each step sets the robot's target pose for that step. 
The robot will move towards that pose using a P controller.
