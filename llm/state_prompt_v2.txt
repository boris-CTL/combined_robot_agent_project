# Karel State Explanation

The Karel state represents a grid world of size n x n, where n is the number of rows and columns. Each cell in the grid contains one of the following:

## Grid Representation
'x': Represents a wall cell. Karel cannot move through these cells.
'.': Denotes an empty cell that Karel can traverse.
'm': Indicates a cell containing exactly 1 marker.
'M': Indicates a cell containing exactly 2 markers.

## Karel's Position and Orientation
Karel's position and orientation in the grid are not represented directly on the grid. Instead, they are described with a separate statement. This description includes Karel's exact coordinates and the direction Karel is facing.

The position is given in coordinates (x, y), where x is the column number and y is the row number.
The orientation is one of the four cardinal directions: North, East, South, or West.

For example:

Consider an 8x8 grid with the following features:

* Walls surround the outer boundary of the grid.
* There is 1 marker in the second cell of the top row.
* There are 2 markers in the second to last cell of the top row.
* Karel is located in the second cell from the left in the bottom row, facing East.
The grid representation would be:

Karel is at (1, 6), facing East
