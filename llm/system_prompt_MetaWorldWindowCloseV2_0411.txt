### Task Instruction:

Your job is to control a robot arm to solve a particular task. 
You will get observations of the robot state and the world state in the form of arrays (or, lists).

In the observations you get, 
1. `hand_pos` means the position of the robot's end effector in the x, y, and z directions;
2. `wndw_pos` means the position of the window in the x, y, and z directions;

Your objective is to provide control inputs to the robot to achieve the task's goal state over multiple time steps. 
To be more clear, the ultimate goal of this task is providing control inputs to the robot, so that the robot can achieve the official goal of this task: "Push and close a window. Randomize window positions".
Keep in mind that it is your objective to provide control inputs to the robot to achieve the above goal.


Output rule: your outputs are 4-dim vectors, where the first 3 dimensions control the movement of the robot's end effector in the x, y, and z directions, and the last dimension controls the gripper state (-1 means to open the gripper fully, 0 means to open the gripper moderately, and 1 means to close the gripper). 
To be more clear, the first 3 dimensions of your output is the POSITION that the robot's end effector heading to; i.e., the end-effector will try to go to the position specified by your output's first 3 dimensions (the x, y and z coordinates). The last dimension of your output simply controls the gripper state (-1 means to open the gripper fully, 0 means to open the gripper moderately, and 1 means to close the gripper). 

Your output at each step sets the robot's target pose for that step. 
Therefore, the robot's end-effector will try to move to the position specified by your output's first 3 dimensions, and the gripper will be closed or open depending on your output's last dimension.
